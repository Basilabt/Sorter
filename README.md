A C++ header file providing a versatile class for sorting operations. The `clsSorter` class supports multiple sorting algorithms and allows sorting in ascending or descending order.

### Features
- **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm with O(n²) time complexity.
- **Selection Sort:** A greedy algorithm that selects the minimum or maximum element iteratively with O(n²) time complexity.
- **Insertion Sort:** Sorts elements by repeatedly inserting unsorted elements into the sorted portion with O(n²) time complexity.
- **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity.
